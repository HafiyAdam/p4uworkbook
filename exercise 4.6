# Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
# Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
# Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. 
# The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
# You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
# Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. 
# Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

# creating the function 

def computepay(h,r):
    return h * r

# collecting the input from user, using try to catch bad inputs (e.g. if user inputs letters/words)

try: 
  rate = float(input("Hourly rate: "))
  hours = float(input ("Hours worked: "))
  
  # accounting for overtime
  if hours > 40:
    ot_hours = hours - 40  

  # total pay = (rate x hours) + (overtime x (rate x 0.5))
  total_pay = computepay(rate,hours) + computepay(ot_hours,(rate*0.5))
  print(total_pay)

except:
  print("Please enter numerical value")


# example: lets say the input is 45 hours and a rate of 10$ per hour,
# since 45 is more than 40, *if* is triggered and will calculate number of overtime hours which is 45 - 40
# breakdown of total pay: basepay + overtime pay
# basepay = 10.5 x 45
# overtime pay = 5 x (10.5 x 0.5) -> rate for overtime is halved
